This is the first file and first change I am making. Let me add this sentence here.
Steps that I followed to do this.
1. git init                    > To intialize git
2. git add and git commit to commit changes locally.
3. git remote add origin url   > To connect it with the online repo
4. git push -u origin master   > To upload changes to online repo
5. git pull                    > To download changes from online repo
NOte:Before every upload from local to online repo you have to add and commit
changes to your local repo.
